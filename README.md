# SelfDrivingCar

The objective of this project is to create a self-driving car that can autonomously navigate a simple racing track. The car's movements are controlled by a deep neural network that takes in distance readings from sensors placed at different angles around the track. The neural network has been implemented from scratch in C#, and is trained using a genetic progression algorithm to optimize its ability to make accurate driving decisions.
